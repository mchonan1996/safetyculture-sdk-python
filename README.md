## Michael changes

# To get working you'll want to do the following:

* Use Python 3 (pretty sure that's what I've been testing this with)

* Copy the `.env.sample` file and name it `.env`, replacing the details in the file with your own safetyculture info.

* Run `pip install dotenv` in commandline.

* Check out `run.py` file (or run it to test)


## Note:
These files are only used in my run script so that I didn't have to add my username/password into GitHub. Feel free to rip out the dotenv related stuff and put your own username/password in `run.py`.
